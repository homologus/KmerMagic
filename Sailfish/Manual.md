Overview {#overview} 
================

Sailfish is a tool for transcript quantification from RNA-seq data.  It
requires a set of target transcripts (either from a reference or _de-novo_
assembly) to quantify.  All you need to run Sailfish is a fasta file containing
your reference transcripts and a (set of) fasta/fastq file(s) containing your
reads.  Sailfish runs in two phases; indexing and quantification.  The indexing
step is independent of the reads, and only need to be run one for a particular
set of reference transcripts and choice of k (the k-mer size). The
quantification step, obviously, is specific to the set of RNA-seq reads and is
thus run more frequently.


Indexing 
--------

To quantify the abundance, in a sample, of a set of target transcripts, you
must first create a Sailfish index of this transcript set.  The Sailfish index
is actually just a collection of different files, kept together inside of a
directory (the directory itself is referred to as the index), that allow
Sailfish to efficiently access the information it needs about the target
transcripts.

The generation of the Sailfish index is performed via the Sailfish `index`
command. Like all user-level commands in Sailfish, `index` is a subcommand of
the main Sailfish program. Thus, the index command is invoked as:

~~~~
> sailfish index [options]
~~~~

The list of options are as follows:

* __-v | --version__ Print the version of Sailfish being used and exit

* __-h | --help__ Print the help message describing the parameters

* __-t | --transcripts__ A FASTA format file containing the transcripts on
  which the index will be built.

* __-m | --tgmap__ Provide a transcript-to-gene map (currently unused)

* __-k | --kmerSize__ The size of the k-mer on which the index is built.  There
  is a tradeoff here between the distinctiveness of the k-mers and their
  robustness to errors.  The shorter the k-mers, the more robust they will be
  to errors in the reads, but the longer the k-mers, the more distinct they
  will be.  We generally recommend using a k-mer size of at least 20.  Because
  of the way k-mers are encoded in Sailfish, the current maximum k-mer size is
  32, but this may change in the future.

* __-o | --out__  The directory in which the Sailfish index will be placed. 

* __-p | --threads__ The maximum number of concurrent threads to use when
  building the index.

* __-f | --force__ If `-o` is provided with a directory that already exists,
  then force the re-building of the index, replacing the current contents of
  that directory.

To generate the Sailfish index for your reference set of transcripts, for
example, you would run a command like the following:

~~~~
> sailfish index -t <ref_transcripts> -o <out_dir> -k <kmer_len>
~~~~

This will build a Sailfish index for k-mers of length \<kmer_len\> for the
reference transcripts  provided in the file \<ref_transcripts\> and place the
index under the directory \<out_dir\>.  

Quantification
--------------

Now that you have generated the Sailfish index (say that it's the directory
\<index_dir\> --- this corresponds to the \<out_dir\> argument provided in the
previous step), you can quantify the transcript expression for a given set of
reads.  Just like the indexing is performed via the `index` sub-command of
Sailfish, quantification is performed via the `quant` sub-command.  The
quantification command is invoked as follows:

~~~~
> sailfish quant [options]
~~~~

The list of options are as follows:

* __-v | --version__ Print the version of Sailfish being used and exit

* __-h | --help__ Print the help message describing the parameters

* __-i | --index__ The path to the Sailfish index built on the set of target
    transcripts.

* __-l | --libtype__ A string describing the library type of the provided
  reads. For a description of the different possible library strings and their
  meanings, see the [library string](#library-string) section below.

* __-r | --unmated_reads__ A list of one or more FASTA or FASTQ format files 
    (or a named pipe providing reads in one of these formats) containing 
    unpaired reads.  This option should directly follow the `-l` option, and
    is only valid if the library format is of type single end (`SE`).

* __-1 | --mates1__ A list of one or more FASTA or FASTQ format files (or a 
    named pipe providing reads in one of these formats) containing the first
    mate for a set of reads.  This option should directoy follow the `-l` 
    option, and is only valid if the library format is of the paired-end type
    (`PE`).

* __-2 | --mates2__  A list of one or more FASTA or FASTQ format files (or a 
    named pipe providing reads in one of these formats) containing the second
    mate for a set of reads.  This option should directoy follow the `-1` 
    option, and is only valid if the library format is of the paired-end type
    (`PE`).  This list should contain the same number of files (paired 
    read-for-read) with the mates provided by the `-1` option.
  
* __--no_bias_correct__  Normally, Sailfish outputs two quantification files in
    the requested output directory, `quant.sf` and `quant_bias_corrected.sf`. If
    this option is provided, bias-correction is not performed and the 
    bias-corrected file is not produced.

* __-m | --min_abundance__ Set to 0 the abundance of any transcripts with a
    computed K-mers Per Kilobase per Million mapped k-mers (KPKM) lower than 
    the provided value.

* __-o | --out__ The output directory where the quantification results (and
    other relevant files) are written.
  
* __-n | --iterations__ The maximum number of iterations of the EM step to carry
    out.  The optimization algorithm that computes the transcript estimates will
    terminate when either the convergence critera specified by the `-d` option 
    (below) is met, or when this number of iterations has been performed.
   
* __-d | --delta__ The maximum allowable delta between consecutive iterations of
    the optimization procedure.  If the maximum relative change in any 
    transcripts' abundance is less than this value between two consecutive 
    iterations of the optimization, then the procedure will be considered to 
    have converged and the optimization will terminate.
   
* __-p | --threads__ The maximum number of threads to use when counting k-mers
    and computing transcript abundance.

* __-f | --force__  By default, if the output folder provided to the `-o`
    option already exists, the k-mer counts recorded by the previous run will
    be used and only the quantification will be performed again.  Passing in 
    this option forces both a re-counting of the k-mers and a re-quantification
    of the target transcripts.

* __-a | --polya__ If this flag is set, then polyA/polyT k-mers will not be
    counted.

So, a typical invocation of th the Sailfish `quant` command will look something
like the following:

~~~~
> sailfish quant -i <index_dir> -l "<libtype>" \
  {-r <unmated> | -2 <mates1> -2 <mates2>} -o <quant_dir>
~~~~

Where \<index_dir\> is, as described above, the location of the Sailfish index,
\<libtype\> is a string describing the format of the read library (see [library
string](#library-string) below) \<unmated\> is a list of files containing
unmated reads, \<mates{1,2}\> are lists of files containing, respectively, the
first and second mates of paired-end reads.  Finally, \<quant_dir\> is the
directory where the output should be written.

When the quantification step is finished, the directory \<quant_dir\> will
contain a file named "quant.sf".  This file contains the result of the Sailfish
quantification step.  This file contains a number of columns (which are listed
in the last of the header lines beginning with '#').  Specifically, the columns
are (1) Transcript ID, (2) Transcript Length, (3) Transcripts per Million
(TPM), (4) Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (RPKM), (5) K-mers
Per Kilobase per Million mapped k-mers (KPKM), (6) Estimated number of k-mers
(an estimate of the number of k-mers drawn from this transcript given the
transcript's relative abundance and length) and (7) Estimated number of reads 
(an estimate of the number of reads drawn from this transcript given the 
transcript's relative abnundance and length).  The first two columns are
self-explanatory, the next four are measures of transcript abundance and the
final is a commonly used input for differential expression tools.  The
Transcripts per Million quantification number is computed as described in [1],
and is meant as an estimate of the number of transcripts, per million observed
transcripts, originating from each isoform.  Its benefit over the K/RPKM measure
is that it is independent of the mean expressed transcript length (i.e. if the
mean expressed transcript length varies between samples, for example, this
alone can affect differential analysis based on the K/RPKM.)  The RPKM is a
classic measure of relative transcript abundance, and is an estimate of the
number of reads per kilobase of transcript (per million mapped reads)
originating from each transcript. The KPKM should closely track the RPKM, but
is defined for very short features which are larger than the chosen k-mer
length but may be shorter than the read length. Typically, you should prefer 
the KPKM measure to the RPKM measure, since the k-mer is the most natural 
unit of coverage for Sailfish.

### Library Format String ### {#library-string}

The library format string is given as a parameter to the `quant` step of
Sailfish.  Since Sailfish works with the reads directly and not alignments,
the purpose of this string is to inform Sailfish of relevant information about
the reads in the library.  Not all of this information is _currently_ used, but
some of it is and other pieces of it may be in the future.

The library format string consists of 3 parts (one of which is sometimes
optional), provided as key-value pairs.  The relevant keys and possible value
options are:

~~~~
(T|TYPE)=(PE|SE)
~~~~

This option specifies the "paired-end" status of the read library.  If the reads
are paired end, then this should be set to `PE`, and the library format string
should be followed by the `-1` and `-2` options with the respective mate-pair
reads.  If the reads are unpaired, then this should be set to `SE` and the
library format string shoujld be followed by the `-r` option and list of files
containing unpaired reads.

~~~~
(O|ORIENTATION)=(>>|<>|><)
~~~~

This option secifies the relative orientation of reads within a pair.  If
the library consists of unpaired reads, then this key-value pair can and should
be ignored.  If the library consists of paired end reads, this key-value pair
should be provided.  Note, this denotes the *realtive orientation* of the reads,
not their absolute directionality with respect to the reference.  The options
are meant to denote, visually, how the reads could be oriented.  

The first option `>>` denotes that the mates are oriented in the same direction
--- e.g. if the 5' end of mate 1 is upstream from the 3' end, then the 5' end
of mate 2 is upstream from its 3' end and vice-versa.

The second option `<>` denotes that the mates are oriented away from each other.
This implies that start of mate1 is closer to start of mate 2 than the end of
mate 2, etc.

The third option `><` is, perhaps, the most common relative orientation.  It
denotes that the mates are oriented toward each other, so that the start of 
mate 1 is farther from the start of mate 2 than it is from the end of mate 2
and vice-versa.

~~~~
(S|STRAND)=(AS|SA|S|A|U)
~~~~

This option specifies the strandedness of the reads.  If the type is `SE` the
only allowable options are `S`, `A`, and `U`, which denote, respectively, that
the reads come from the sense strand, the antisense strand, or are of unknown
strandedness (in which case both strands are tried and the one resulting in
more matching k-mers is used).

If the type of the read library is `PE`, then any of the options are valid. The
`S`, `A` and `U` options given in the above paragraph have the same meaning. The
`AS` option specifies that mate 1 is from the antisense strand and mate2 is from
the sense strand, while `SA` specifies that mate 1 is from the sense strand and
mate 2 is from the antisense strand.

Because of the way argument parsing works, the library format string must be
offset by quotations. An example format string specifying that the read library
consists of unpaired reads with unknown orientation is:

~~~~
-l "T=SE:S=U"
~~~~

Alternatively, a format string specifying that the read library consists of
paired-end reads, oriented toward each other where mate 1 is from the sense
strand and mate 2 is from the antisense strand is:

~~~
-l "T=PE:O=><:S=SA"
~~~

Many, but not all, combinations of the three options (type, orientation and
strandedness) are possible.  Sailfish will perform a coarse-grained sainty
check to ensure that the provided library string is not impossible (e.g.
`T=SE:O=><:S=A`, which is not possible because unpaired reads can't have a
relative orientation).
